	<h3 style="color:revert;">1.Engineers Make flying Computer chips the size of Sand Grains</h3>
	<p style="color:black; text-align: justify;">The new chips, or "microfliers," are not equipped with motors or engines. Instead, much like a maple tree's propeller seed, they fly on the wind, twirling like helicopter blades through the air toward the ground.The researchers suggest that swarms of microfliers could get dropped from planes or buildings to monitor the environment, such as after chemical spills.

	<h3 style="color:revert;">2.Autonomous package delivers </h3>
	<p style="color:black; text-align:  justify;">By 2030, delivery vehicles are expected to increase by 36% over 2019 numbers across the world's 100 most populated cities, resulting in a corresponding rise in greenhouse gas emissions. Increases in traffic congestion and decreases in parking availability could also contribute to the amount of pollution each vehicle produces.<br>To solve these problems -- and reduce labor costs companies are experimenting with autonomous delivery vehicles. Previous research on self-driving passenger cars has shown that because this technology is able to drive much more efficiently than humans, it could reduce traffic jams and, in turn, decrease pollution.

	<h3 style="color:revert;">3.New Device Purifies Water with Static Electricity </h3>
	<p style="color:black; text-align:justify;">Recent advances in the technology may ultimately improve access to clean water, though not without some upgrades.The electric field then destroys the cell membranes of bacteria in the water -- droplet by droplet -- through a process called electroporation. The experiment tested water contaminated with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, which can cause a variety of life-threatening diseases such as appendicitis and sepsis, respectively. Each strain of bacteria was completely inactivated in the water samples after two trips through the machine.

	<h3 style="color:revert;">1.Ice Holds Evidence of Ancient, Massive Solar Storm</h3>
	<p style="color:black; text-align: justify;">An analysis of radioactive chemicals in ice cores indicates one of the most powerful solar storms ever hit Earth around 7176 B.C.The event created distinctive radioactive varieties of beryllium and chlorine in the atmosphere; those isotopes then fell to the ground with the yearly seasonal snowfall and were preserved in layers of ancient ice.

	<h3 style="color:revert;">2.NASA's Next-Generation Space Telescope Will Do Science at a Special Spot</h3>
	<p style="color:black; text-align: justify;">the largest and most powerful space telescope ever built is scheduled to hurtle into space from a launch point near Kourou, French Guiana. It will spend a month traveling roughly a million miles from Earth to a special spot called the second Lagrange point, or L2. L2 is just 1% farther away from the sun than Earth is, forming a straight line with the star and planet.
